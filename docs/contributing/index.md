# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the codebase! Areas where contributions are especially helpful include:

- Data
    - Support for geospatial datasets beyond ERA5 and DCPP (download scripts, dataloaders)
    - Support for formats beyond Xarray (NetCDF, Zarr, etc.), such as CSV
    - Support for alternative storage backends (e.g. cloud storage)
- Modeling
    - New model backbones and architectures
    - Additional training schemes beyond flow-matching
- Visualization
    - Improved metric plotting support
    - Visualization tools for geospatial data

See the [Contribute to project](contribute.md) section for details on how to get started with development, including setting up your environment, coding standards, and submitting pull requests.

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please read the [Bug reporting and feature requests](bug.md) section.
