# ArchesWeather and ArchesWeatherGen

geoarches can be used to run both the deterministic and generative weather forecasting models, **ArchesWeather** and **ArchesWeatherGen** respectively.

See the Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12971](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12971)

We provide the saved models and code to run inference, evaluation and training.
